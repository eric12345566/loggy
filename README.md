Sometimes, you need a logger for your program for a better coding experience.
Something like multiple type of logging(debug, info, warning, or you can define your type), better with different colors. Maybe more,
have some theme for the cute log. Right now, Loggy can be your second choice.

## Install

Right now, we are still in early dev. version. We don't recommend using it in serious project.

If you really have interest to test it, please clone it with git and run our test py file for demo.
You can also import the Loggy Class to new the logger object into your other python code
(See Wiki file for more info).

In the future, we will upload Loggy to pip so everyone can install in one command. 

```shell
pip install (package name, we dont have it right now)
```
